Selling art on the web has never been an easy task, many artists resort to using social media in order to promote their art. 

We want to provide a platform for these artists in order to gather exposure and build a following. This platform will allow users to view othersâ€™ works, as well as easily request commissions. We would like to create a website that resembles a portfolio for artists where they can display their work and help them organize their future projects. Our calendar can help users manage their time in order to meet deadlines set by them. 

A great problem that artists face is the lack of inspiration as well as lack of motivation. In order to counter this, we would also like to add the feature to create a starter pack for the user when they have an art block, giving them a random medium and prompt. We see this website as a reliable tool for artists, an all-in-one package in order for them to easily manage their portfolios and manage commissions.
